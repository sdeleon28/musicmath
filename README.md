This is mostly a representation of what music theory looks like in my head.

## Motivation

I wanted to make mappings for Reaper to show interval names on each note of the MIDI editor. While I was at it, I went on the giant rabbit hole of representing my current mental model of music theory into a library that I could potentially use for calculating things. This will most likely end up being one of those throw away projects that I never end up using, but has certainly been a fun and enlightening little experiment.

## Features

* Generates all keys
* Generates all modes for those keys
* Generates note name mappings for displaying interval names in the Reaper MIDI editor
